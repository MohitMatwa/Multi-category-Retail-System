# Multi-category-Retail-System

This repository contains the source code for a Multi-category Retail System. It is a C++ program that allows users to browse and order items from different categories such as electronics, eatables, drinkables, and others.

Description:-

The program uses various data structures and functions to implement the ordering system. Here is a brief overview of the components and functionality:

Login System: Users can register and login to the system using a username and password. This feature ensures that only registered users can place orders.

Item Class: The program includes an item class that encapsulates the properties and operations related to items available in the mall. Each item has attributes such as name, type, unit, price, and stock. The class provides functions to set initial values, print items of a specific type, search for items using a subsequence, check item availability, calculate the amount with GST, and handle user choices of serial number and quantity.

Main Menu: After logging in, users are presented with a main menu where they can choose a category to browse items. The available categories are electronics, eatables, drinkables, and others.

Item Search: Users can enter a subsequence of item names to search for specific items. The program will display all items whose names contain the entered subsequence.

Order Placement: Users can select items by their corresponding serial numbers and enter the desired quantity. The program checks the availability of the selected quantity and calculates the total amount with GST. Users can continue ordering more items or proceed to checkout.

Order Summary: Once the user finishes ordering, a summary of the selected items, quantities, and the total cost is displayed. The user is then prompted to provide additional details such as their name, shipping address, pincode, and phone number.

Feedback: After completing the order, users are asked to rate the service on a scale of 1 to 5. Users can provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.

Usage:-

To run the program, you can compile and execute the C++ code using a C++ compiler. The code uses standard input/output for user interaction. Follow the prompts on the console to register/login, browse items, place orders, and provide feedback.

Note: The code provided is a standalone implementation of the Multi-category Retail System and may require additional modifications and improvements to suit specific needs.
